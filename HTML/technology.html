            <h1>HOW IDEs HELP ME AS AN IT STUDENT</h1>

                IDE is any application that makes coding or programming much easier. Sometimes I wonder why IT students like me are always required to use IDEs. How come there are so many IDEs? Why are IDEs that is required for us sometimes come down to preference? This blog aims to answer all those questions and show my understanding about IDEs.
            </p>

            <p>
                First of all, I want to give the IDEs that I have used so far in my college years. This includes multi-language IDE, language specific, and even web IDEs.
            </p>

                <span class="caption">IDEs I've used</span>
            </div>

            <ul>
                <li>Eclipse</li>
                <li>Visual Studio Code</li>
                <li>PyCharm</li>
                <li>RStudio</li>
                <li>Trinket</li>
                <li>CodeChum</li>
                <li>CodePen</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                After using all these IDEs, I want to explain the importance of it in my personal experience. An obvious advantage of IDEs is that a program is easier to run with just one click unlike coding it raw on notepad and using command prompt to run a java program manually like what I used to do in SHS. I want to start with the automation of code editing. Some IDEs that I've used have the same feature where they show how a specific code is structured and suggestions to your current code that I can just press 'tab' to complete that specific line of my code.
            </p>

            <p>
                Another helpful feature that I've noticed is that when there is a mistake in my code, it is underlined with color red. This helps me correct that specific line of code immediately so that later on when I run my program, it won't be too much of a hassle to backtrack. I like that most of the IDEs I use doesn't need too much system requirements, open-source, and free.
            </p>

            <p>
                Overall, it's obvious that for IT students like me should use IDEs for them to have more efficient learning of programming. There are many different IDEs because some of them are general-purpose which supports different programming languages and some are language specific. I think having a preferred IDE to use comes down to the accessibility, availability, and personal preference.
