                <h2>Tourist Spot in Beijing, China</h2>
                <p>Walking on the Great Wall is about seeing a huge piece of history with my own eyes. It is just amazing to think about how long it has been there. I want to walk along the old stone paths and see the towers on the hills. It is a great way to learn about the culture and see how people built something so massive a long time ago.</p>
