                My name is Gab, and I was born and raised in Manila. I remember when I was in preschool, my grandmother used to escort me to the nursery school. I cannot recall if I did well in my studies, but I still remember the fun times when I had a tutor. I was a playful kid and had a really short attention span, so I guess my tutor had a hard time teaching me. After preschool, I was taken to the province to get my primary education. I only studied there for 1st grade, but there were a lot of memories. All the friends I made used to play with me within our relatives' compound. I remember the wounds I had when we played chase, hide and seek, capture the flag and other made-up games. Back then, I did not have any technology. All I had were toys and books, but most of the time I just played with my toys. Another fun memory is when my grandmother used to tell me to sleep during the afternoon so I could grow tall, but I always ended up sneaking out of the house to play with my cousins. When I finished 1st grade, my parents took me back to Manila to study at the University of the East due to my mom’s office being near it. During my first day I was scared and nervous because I had more classmates than when I was studying in the province. I managed to make friends with a guy whom I cannot remember now, but I know we were good friends. After 2nd grade, I met this girl whom I am now still friends with till this day. This girl is who I tell my crushes about and basically became an older sister for me. I also got into a circle of friends that were nice and playful like me. My education back then was pretty good, but I remember failing one subject and that is art, because I am really not a creative kid. A lot of teachers back then said that I have wasted potential because I am smart, and I’m just not putting the work in because of my attention span. Overall, I graduated elementary and entered high school where a lot of my elementary classmates and friends left.

                At the start of 7th grade, once again, I was nervous that I didn't know anyone, especially with the ‘Introduce Yourself’. I am an introverted teenager. I can talk to people very well if they are the ones to start the conversation, but I can only start conversations with people I already know. Luckily, the girl I’m friends with is my classmate. We never separated sections all throughout elementary, so I’m surprised. Since I’m trying to get to know more people, I tried sitting with other people and, after a while, I made friends with the people in my row. However, I was very talkative, so the teacher transferred my seat to the last row, where I also met some classmates who became my friends later on. Most of my teenage years revolved around school, which is not bad because I had the best memories. I used to enjoy all the projects when the whole section was involved, like performances or theatrical plays. The rehearsal and preparation of props and costumes were always so fun that my friends and I always played with it, but of course, when it’s rehearsal time we’re focused. During 8th grade, I had a new circle of friends that I’m still close to up until today and also became my family. We created memes and posted them on a Facebook page that we also created that gathered ten thousand followers and that was one of the most memorable moments I had. Outside of school, I had this subgroup within our circle of friends that are anime fans, and we used to watch anime movies in cinemas on a random weekend. On a random week, it was announced that we would have a 2-week suspension due to a virus that soon became a 2-year suspension. When online classes started, I was a little unfamiliar since it was the first time I had a laptop, but I managed to learn and use it well. During that time, I became the president of a club and I tried my best to be among the ‘With Honors’ students, which I actually got into. After the pandemic, when I was in senior high school, specifically 12th grade, I started to take my life seriously, and I started going to the gym, having a fixed routine and organized schedule. Around that time is also when a friend of our circle left to live in another country, which is very sad, but fortunately, we managed to give him a farewell gathering. My teenage years were fun even though we lost some friends because of going to another country or just cutting us off for no reason. I managed to finish senior high school and graduate as an ‘Honor’ student. I tried my best to reach ‘High Honors’, but I’m still grateful to have an achievement like that and make my parents get up the stage during my graduation.

                Entering my college year is terrifying and also very stressful at first. Although I was an ICT student in senior high school, I was not confident with my programming knowledge. I know the basics, but I was really nervous that when I entered college it would be more complex, and we would discuss very advanced topics. Luckily, it was not that hard, and most of the lessons were actually already discussed or just continuations of what I remember in senior high. During my 1st year, it was easy because my schedule was not that complicated, and we had an afternoon dismissal, so I was able to go to the gym and study after. As the semester went on, I learned things that were not only important but also became very interesting for me, like different programming languages. I was fascinated by how many programming languages it is possible to create a program with a similar or not so different syntax. The history subject is also very interesting for me, but maybe it was just because of how our professor taught us. We had an exam where we would have a historical trip but, unfortunately, I did not have enough money to pay, so I just took the written exam. I didn’t join organizations unless required because I think I cannot handle being on one of the tasks professors give sometimes. However, I did enjoy my NSTP program, which is civic welfare, where I also made friends on another course and had a sense of purpose where I helped something in the community. My PATHFIT, a.k.a. Physical education is also fun. Sometimes we were asked to watch sports competitions which me and the friends I made could consider a hangout. After my 1st year, things got a bit complicated. I had a really messed-up schedule which had a lot of unnecessary vacancies and our dismissal was almost in the evening. Looking on the bright side, if there was an exam or quiz, we could use the vacant time to study and prepare. I could also say my PATHFIT was the most enjoyable out of that semester because we had art and most of the time the coach complimented me for learning moves fast. Meanwhile, my academic situation is decent except for one subject, which is discrete mathematics. I was always bad at math, even when I was a kid, so I really had a hard time studying it, but thankfully I passed it. That’s about it, that was my life and my college experience. At the time being, hopefully I will pass this 2nd semester of my 2nd year even though my schedule is a bit tiring.
