                Have you ever heard the saying "99% of gamblers quit before their big win"? We all know that in gambling, even when you win, you lose. Now am I a gambler, kind of, however, I did gamble in many forms and it's not what you think. Did I overcome it? This blog will tell my experience towards gambling but not in the usual way.
            </p>

                Before I tell you my story, let me explain to you the different types of gambling.

                I have tried all the gambling types in Physical and Online games but never in a Casino. Well of course I won't go to a casino because I'm only 19 years old and the legal age is 21 to enter. However, I did already spent a lot of money gambling in different ways. It all started back on pandemic when I played a mobile game called Call of Duty Mobile.

                Here are other games I spent money to get rare and time-limited in-game items.

                Earlier last year, I just discovered Gashapon which is a Japanese token-operated machines in which you get really cool stuff. It has anime, k-pop, and even game collectibles. Of course me and my friends just had to try it and yes, I got hooked immediately with it. Just before last year ended, I got into card collection which is called One Piece TCG that has random cards in packs and have already spent a lot of money in a small amount of time. 
            </p>

            <p>
                There is a random day this month that I cleaned and have gone through my stuff and realized that I do have already a lot to collect and noticed I am lacking space so I decided to declutter. I gave away some of my collections to my friends who I deem worthy of having. Since then, I promised not to indulge in this anymore because I could adapt it as I grow older.
            </p>

            <p>
                Overall, I won't say that my experience with gambling is bad, I'd say it's the best I've ever done so far. All the memories I made pulling with my friends are so memorable, the dopamine boost, and even the sad times when we realize we spent a lot of money. It does have it's downsides but my idea all along was to collect and not just gamble.
