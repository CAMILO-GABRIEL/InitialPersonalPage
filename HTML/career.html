                When I was growing up, I thought working in IT was just about fixing computers or downloading files. Now that I am building a blog using code, I realize I was wrong. It is much more than that. Before I started college, I worried a lot about my future. I asked myself, "Will I find a job? Will it be too hard?" Here is where I hope to be in five years.

                When I started my first year of college, I was very nervous. I felt like I forgot everything I learned in high school. I passed my first year, but I still feel like I have a lot to learn. To be honest, I felt confused by all the different coding languages we had to learn at the same time. It was too much for my brain. I have a new plan now: I will study one language at a time in my free time until I get used to it. My biggest struggle right now is logic. Memorizing the code is easy for me, but using that code to solve a problem is actually very hard.

                In five years, I don't just want any job. I want to be an expert at something specific. Here are the main steps I plan to take:

                <li>Get Real Practice</li>
                <li>Get My Dream Job</li>
                <li>Help My Parents</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                There are many paths in IT, and I still haven't picked one. But I have learned an important lesson: never quit just because you can't do something perfectly the first time. I realized that practicing a little bit every day is better than trying to learn everything at once. I need to stop worrying about not getting a job. Instead, I will study hard, practice daily, and keep learning.
