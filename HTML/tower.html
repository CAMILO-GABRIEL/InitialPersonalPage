                <h2>Clock Tower in London, England</h2>
                <p>I’ve always thought Big Ben was one of the coolest buildings in the world. The way it is built is so impressive. I want to see the giant clock faces up close and hear the bell ring. For me, it is just a really beautiful example of how buildings were made to last, and I want to see how the whole thing works.</p>
